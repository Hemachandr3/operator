Dhoni once wished to join a  reputed Cricket Coaching Camp to be held at a place "X" kms away from his house. He told about this to his father and got his consent to use his friend's bike for the Camp. The Camp was to be held on all days of the month. His friend's bike provides a mileage of Y km/litre and the cost of petrol was Rs. Z. Dhoni's father now wanted to know the total amount that was needed by Dhoni to spend on his travel to the Camp. Help him find the same and assume number of days in a month as 30 days.

MS Dhoni is a grade A player according to BCCI Central Contracts in 2016. MSD's net worth in 2016 is around 31 million and is said to be the richest Indian cricketer.
Apart from his salary as an Indian cricketer, Dhoni endorses various popular brands and earns a large amount from endorsements. Besides that individual and team bonuses are also given on the basis of individual and team performances. So precisely the sources of income for Dhoni are from - Salary, Bonuses and Awards through Winning and Endorsements.
Write a program that finds Dhoni's percentage of income earned from each of the 3 individual sources.
Output Format:
Output should display 3 floats in a line, separated by a space. The first float corresponds to the percentage of income from Salary, the second float corresponds to the percentage of income from Bonuses and Awards and the third float corresponds to the percentage of income from endorsements.
All float values should be displayed correct to 2 decimal places.

Extras are runs scored by a means other than a batsman hitting the ball. A batsman is not given credit for extras other than runs scored off the bat from a no ball, and the extras are tallied separately on the scorecard and count only towards the team’s score. the types of extras are No ball, Wide, Bye, Leg-bye and Penalty. 1 Penalty corresponds to 5 runs.
Find the total runs that the Extras contribute to the team’s score, given the number of No-balls, wides, byes, leg-byes and penalty given off by the bowlers in innings.

Tamilnadu was battling one if it’s worst floods in a century last December, as several part of the state have been submerged and cut off from essential supplies. It was heartening that the Cricketers came forward to contribute for the cause of floods and it was decided amongst the team that the senior players donate 50% of their salary and junior players to donate 40% against the flood relief measures
Assume there are 6 senior players and 5 junior players. The salary of senior players Rs.X and that of junior players is Rs.Y. Find the total contribution from the cricket team towards the floods.

Ajay, Binoy and Chandru were very close friends at school. They were very good in Mathematics and they were the pet students of Emily Mam. Their gang was known as 3-idiots. Ajay, Binoy and Chandru live in the same locality. A new student Dinesh joins their class and he wanted to be friends with them. He asked Binoy about his house address. Binoy wanted to test Dinesh's mathematical skills. Binoy told Dinesh that his house is at the midpoint of the line joining Ajay's house and Chandru's house. Dinesh was puzzled. Can you help Dinesh out? Given the coordinates of the 2 end points of a line (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), write a python program to find the midpoint of the line. Input Format: Input consists of 4 integers. The first integer corresponds to x1 . The second integer corresponds to y1. The third and fouth integers correspond to x2 and y2 respectively.
